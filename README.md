# 🜏 Mage: The Ascension Tarot – Next.js Reading App

A modern **Next.js** web app for performing **Tarot readings** using the **Mage: The Ascension** deck.  
This project blends **esoteric symbolism** and **interactive storytelling** with a clean and dynamic interface, allowing users to explore mystical readings, archetypes, and Mage lore through digital Tarot spreads.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🃏 **Mage: The Ascension Tarot Deck**  
  Full digital representation of the official Mage deck, with major and minor arcana descriptions.

- 🔮 **Interactive Readings**  
  Choose from multiple spread types (e.g. One-Card, Three-Card, Celtic Cross, Sphere of Influence).

- ⚙️ **Randomized Draws with Weighted Archetypes**  
  Custom logic to simulate “magical resonance” — allowing unique draws and narrative combinations.

- 📖 **Card Meanings & Interpretations**  
  Integrated lore, upright and reversed interpretations, and connections to Mage Spheres.

- 🎨 **Elegant UI/UX**  
  Built with **Next.js 15**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and atmospheric transitions.

- 🧙 **Extensible Architecture**  
  Designed for future expansions (e.g. alternate decks, AI-generated readings, user-saved spreads).
